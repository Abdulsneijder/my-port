<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Abdullahi Ekpoki! I’m a lifelong learner and challenge-seeker,
    always ready to dive into new projects and expand my <br /> skill  set. 
    With expertise in Adobe Photoshop, 
    I enjoy creating <br /> visually striking images through photo retouching and <br/> manipulation, 
    where creativity meets precision.</p>

<P>My goals are driven by a commitment to achieve meaningful <br /> results in whatever
    I set out to do. Currently, I’m on a journey <br /> to  establish myself as a blockchain
    analyst, web developer, and Solidity engineer, where I can contribute to the 
    future of <br /> decentralized technology. I believe in blending technical skills <br /> 
    with a creative mindset to bring unique solutions to the table.</P>

<p>When I’m not working on the latest tech trend or creative project, <br />
    I’m likely exploring new tools or studying industry innovations. <br /> 
    I’m excited about the future and eager to make an impact in fields <br /> 
    that shape tomorrow.</p>
